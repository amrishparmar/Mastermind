# Mastermind
An implementation of Mastermind game and strategies for AI solutions. Coursework for Year 2 programming module.

There are three parts:
* **PlayerVsCPU** - Allows the player to play a standard game of Mastermind
* **CPUVsPlayer** - The player chooses the hidden pegs which the AI proceeds to guess
* **StategyComparisons** - A CL application that runs 100 games of each of two implemented algorithms to calculate average and worst case performance

Full discussion of the algorithms used can be found in Mastermind Strategies.docx.

Compilation and execution instructions can be found in the respective \_\_README\_\_.txt of each subfolder.
